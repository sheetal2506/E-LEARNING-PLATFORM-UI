As the creator of this web project, my goal was to design and develop a comprehensive, visually appealing, and user-friendly platform for online exam preparation—branded as EduMaster/EduStream/EduLearn. I created several interconnected HTML pages for different functionalities including homepage, student dashboard, sign-up/login pages, video library, course enrollment, and payment gateway.

Tools and Technologies Used
I developed this project using HTML5 and CSS3 as the core technologies. The pages were written and tested using Visual Studio Code, a lightweight and powerful code editor that provides live server support and syntax highlighting. No external frameworks like Bootstrap or JavaScript libraries were used—this was a deliberate choice to showcase my pure front-end skills using only native HTML and CSS.

Design and UI Approach
To enhance the visual appeal, I used linear-gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism-style containers, and elevated shadow effects across all pages. Each section (like headers, buttons, forms, and cards) was carefully styled using modern CSS properties like backdrop-filter, box-shadow, border-radius, and keyframe animations (fadeIn, slideDown, etc.) to create a lively, interactive UI.

I followed a mobile-responsive approach using flexbox and grid layout, ensuring all components adapt gracefully to different screen sizes. For typography, I used modern system fonts like 'Segoe UI' and 'Tahoma' for readability and a clean look.

Page Breakdown
mainfile.html is the landing page that introduces the platform and features a navigation bar, animated tabs, and course cards for JEE, NEET, CAT, etc. I implemented a custom-designed button and tab layout with hover effects and smooth transitions.

signup.html and login.html allow new users to register or log in. These forms include input validation visuals, error/success states, and custom checkboxes. I also implemented a password toggle feature and social login buttons for enhanced interactivity.

dashboard.html offers a student view of progress, upcoming assignments, schedules, and quick links. It is one of the most complex pages in the project, making use of a CSS-based grid system and animated elements to provide a real-time dashboard feel.

videolibrary.html simulates a video streaming interface with a playlist sidebar, video player area, progress tracking, and lecture details. Though no JavaScript is used, it is fully styled to appear functional and engaging.

enrollment.html includes a multi-step enrollment form with step indicators, validation highlights, and a summary card at the end. I structured it for future JavaScript enhancement with already embedded UI states.

payment.html provides a visually secure payment experience with UPI, QR, and net banking options. Though static, I ensured it resembles real-world UI by adding animations, QR placeholders, and a disabled payment state.

Final Thoughts
Throughout this project, my focus was on attention to detail, modern UI trends, and clean code structure. This project is a testament to my front-end development capabilities and understanding of responsive web design, user experience, and visual storytelling using only HTML and CSS. My aim was to create an immersive educational interface that feels professional, intuitive, and ready for dynamic integration in the future.
